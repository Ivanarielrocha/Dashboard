## Project Description
A simple dashboard with no functionality as a practise of CSS grid

## My takeaways from this project
I didn't know CSS grid prior to this last few projects (most of which are not uploaded here). I think the most important lesson is that knowing Flexbox is great, it's useful but it's not everything. That said, grid is really cool and you can do pretty much everything with those two things, but the key part is knowing **what to do with which technology**.

I may be wrong, but for this project I really enjoyed giving the basic layout to _grid_, using repeat, combined with minmax and autofit made the whole thing really easier and if I were to write this with Flexbox only I could've taken a lot longer to finish it.

That said, the header was really easy to do with Flexbox and I don't think approaching that part with grid would've felt as natural as with Flexbox. 

It doesn't matter what tools you use, knowing more will give you the flexibility to choose which one feels the most natural for every job.
